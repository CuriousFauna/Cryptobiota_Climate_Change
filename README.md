# Cryptobiota and Climate Change
This is a repository for code and data used in the analysis of the manuscript entitled: "Biodiversity of coral reef cryptobiota shuffles but does not decline under the combined stressors of ocean warming and acidification".

## Fastq Sequences
Fastq files were submited to NCBI through Genome -https://geome-db.org/workbench/project-overview. The NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) numbers for this project are SRS7105074-SRS7105095 and can be obtained here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra. 

The demultiplexed fastq files are named ArmsMeso1 thru 22. There are two files, one forward and one reverse for each treatment: ArmsMeso1.1 = forward and ArmsMeso1.2 = reverse. The treatment names that correspond to the ArmsMeso numbers are in the MetaData.csv file located in the Data folder.

Sequences were processed through the JAMP pipeline - https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP. See manuscript supplement for details.

The JAMP pipeline output is the 3_Raw_MOTU_Table.csv file located in the Data Folder.
